# hello world

welcome to my digital garden. this blog system is built with 0 frameworks—just raw HTML, JS, and Markdown.

### why?
because sometimes, **less is more**. i wanted a space to document my learning in AI safety and engineering without the overhead of a complex CMS.

### code snippet
```python
def hello():
    print("hello from the static void")
```

stay tuned for more updates on my experiments with agents and transformers.
